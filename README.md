This project focuses on developing a recommendation system for online courses, leveraging collaborative filtering techniques to suggest relevant courses to users based on their enrollment patterns and course genres. The analysis begins with an exploration of course data, including counts by genre and enrollment distribution. Key insights are drawn from the popularity of courses, with titles like "Python for Data Science" emerging as top choices. The project employs various data processing and feature engineering techniques, utilizing user profiles and course attributes to create an effective recommendation engine. The goal is to enhance user engagement by providing tailored course suggestions that align with user interests and behaviors.
